# OWASP Coimbra Chapter

Welcome to the official page of the **OWASP Coimbra Chapter**!

## About Us

The OWASP Coimbra Chapter is part of the [Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the security of software.

Our mission is to build and grow a local community in the Coimbra region focused on **application security (AppSec)**, through open collaboration, sharing of knowledge, and promotion of secure development practices.

We welcome everyone — professionals, students, researchers, and enthusiasts — to join us and be part of the conversation.

## What We Do

- Organize meetups and community events
- Host technical talks and hands-on workshops
- Share resources and AppSec content
- Connect people interested in cybersecurity and secure software development

## Join Us

Whether you're just starting in AppSec, studying, already working in the field, or simply an enthusiast, the OWASP Coimbra Chapter is open to all.

You can find our social media links in the menu on the side.

Stay tuned for upcoming events and initiatives!
